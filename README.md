# RoboForge AI 🤖
> **A Generative Robotics Engineering Platform**

## 🚀 Overview
RoboForge AI is a specialized engineering assistant that bridges the gap between conceptual design and technical specification. It utilizes **Google Gemini 3 Flash** to synthesize mechanical constraints, component lists, and functional control logic from natural language prompts.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, Framer Motion
* **AI Inference:** Google Gemini API (Multimodal)
* **Visualization:** Recharts (Telemetry), Lucide React (UI)

## ✨ Key Features
* **Generative CAD Logic:** Converts text prompts (e.g., "Mars Rover") into structured JSON specifications.
* **Real-time Telemetry:** Simulates hardware sensor data (Torque, Battery, Thermal) for UI prototyping.
* **Component Estimator:** Automatically generates a bill of materials (BOM) for the synthesized robot.
